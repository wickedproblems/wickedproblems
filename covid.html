            <p class="blog-post-meta">December 15, 2022 By: Raymond Moy</p>
            <img src="covid.jpg" class = "mb-2 rounded mx-auto d-block" style="height:300px;">
            <p>A relatively recent problem that only showed up three years ago, COVID-19 has rapidly become a wicked problem. Within the field of economics, COVID-19 has caused an astonishing disruption, with "the number of people in extreme poverty [rising from] 70 million to more than 700 million people. The global extreme poverty rate reached 9.3 percent, up from 8.4 percent in 2019" according to the World Bank, and it will be more difficult in the future to resolve the issue ("Poverty" 2022). Within the political field and even the scientific field, there were great debates that contradict the way forward: some advocated "against lockdown measures to favor a containment approach based on a focused protection of the vulnerable" while others still pushed for "restrictive lockdown-like measures to prevent the uncontrolled spread of the virus and the subsequent collapse of healthcare systems" (Angeli, Camporesi, and Fabbro 2021). Due to its "high infection rate as well as its global scalability," COVID becomes an extremely difficult problem to solve (Moon 2020, 1). </p>
            <h3>Global Health</h3>
            <p>COVID-19 has provided an opportunity in global health to reflect on the effectiveness of current health procedures and policies. Within this, professor of public 
                administration and dean of social 
                sciences at Yonsei University has crafted a comparison between the current pandemic and the 2015 MERS outbreak in South Korea (1). Finding that South Korea has "learned costly lessons 
from the MERS failure." South Korea has now exhibited considerable success in COVID-19 (3). By employing an "agile and adaptive approach" that aimed to proactively find "each infected case and exposed cases as fast as possible," as well as having transparency and a cooperative citizen population, South Korea contained the disease rather well (3-4). With this success in a wicked problem, South Korea crafts a model to deal with further pandemics.</p>
